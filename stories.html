    <h1 class="display-4">Trekking the Himalayas</h1>
    <p >In October 2007, I trekked the Annapurna Circuit in the Himalayas. It is the most unforgettable two weeks I have had in my life. Lacking trekking experiences and proper clothings and gears, I somehow survived the 2 weeks of constant battles with the forces of nature. The trek started at Besisahar (800m), going counter-clockwise up to the highest point at Thorung La Pass (5416m), and then down to Jomsom (2800m). The trek took 14 days from Besisahar to Jomsom, where I took a flight (on a 19-passenger twin turboprop plane) back to Pokhara.</p>

    <p>In September 2007, I hopped on a local bus in SW China and began a six-day, multi-bus journey on the the ancient Tea & Horse caravan route. The destination is Lhasa, Tibet. This Tea & Horse route that winds through deep gorges and canyons, though extremely treacherous, is stunningly beautiful.</p>

    <p>Legend had that the Buddhist master Guru Rinpoche (蓮花生) from the 8th century had spent several years mediating in a cave in Tibet. The cave became a popular pilgrimage site for Buddhist but thankfully it is still off-the-beaten-track. </p>
